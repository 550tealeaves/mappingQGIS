# Introduction to Mapping

**Description of workshop**: We all know that it’s expensive to live in NYC, but would you need to make a lot more than the average household income in order to live by one of the cities most popular tourist attractions? In this workshop we will plot 10 popular sites and compare their location to neighborhood data on the median household income of Manhattan residents. We will use QGIS to format the data. Then we will use ArcGIS online to create an interactive map. We will also create an ESRI Story Map in order to add more context to our mapping project. 

By the end of this workshop you will be able to produce an interactive story map that is similar to [this example](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/179f0bdb4f4c4d5aa820641dd9b9da86)
