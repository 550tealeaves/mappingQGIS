We’re going to begin making an ESRI Story map so you can see how it works.
Here’s all of the context that you need

New York City’s Top 10 Attractions
Can you afford to live nearby?

We all know that it’s expensive to live in NYC, but would you need to make a lot more than the average income in order to live by one of the city’s most popular tourist attractions? 

$115,000 and up!
With the exception of the Apollo Theater all of the sites are located in neighborhoods with a median household income greater than $115,000.

Statue of Liberty
The average income for Manhattanites who live the closest to the Statue of Liberty is 134,266!

Rockefeller Center
Most of NYC's tourist sites are actually located in the same neighborhood--Midtown/Midtown South! While this is very convenient for tourists, it's also clear that one needs a lot of money to live in this area since the median household income is $116,456.
